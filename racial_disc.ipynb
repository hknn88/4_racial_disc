    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "First, the sample size is 2435, so it is considered large. Second, by the trial design, observations are independent of each other, so Central Limit Theorem applies. The goal of the study is to compare responses to resumes based on their perceived race, in particular to detect if there is race discrimination of the callbacks to submitted resumes. This can be cast into a problem of analysis of means of two groups, whites and blacks. So, two sample t-test is appropriate.\n",

    "We compared callback frequencies for white and black sounding names on the job seeking resumes in Chicago and Boston areas. We found that there is a substantial difference of 50% between callback frequencies. This is a large effect. By performing further statistical analysis in the form of two sample t-test, we determined that this is a statistically significant effect with very small p-value of $3.9*10^{-5}$. This implies that the race/name is one of the important factors in the callback success, but it is not the only one. There are other factors which change the callback frequency substantially, such as years of experience, quality of the resume, mailing address etc. This suggests further analysis in the form of correlation analysis and logistic regression.
